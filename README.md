# Chorus Interview

## About this Interview

Welcome to Chorus Engineering's Interview project!

We're looking for engineers are experienced, passionate, and are obsessed over strong systems and high productivity.

In order to facilitate this, we use this interview project as a pretend project that mirrors the exact technical stack that we use
here at Chorus.

**You, the interviewee, have the power to decide if this is the technology that you want to work on!**

The goal of this interview is to identify as much about you as we can through a simple take home project, and then
a 1 hour pairing session on the take home project where we create features together.
